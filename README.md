Objective of this Project:

The objective of this project is to analyze "how individual's preference towards one (or several closely related) subjects might shift under external influence".

The case which was chosen to study is the 2016 presidential election, since this is certainly a major media and public focus point. Twitter was chosen as the data source, primarily due to its free twitter API. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How this Objective is pursued:

In order to achieved such objective, one has to download and analyze huge amounts of social media data. In this case, I downloaded 18 continuous days' worth of data from twitter API (July 13 to Aug 2, 2016), roughly 120GB. The reason that one needs such a large, continuous data set is because: 1st, since we are trying to understand individual's shifting opinions, we naturally what to have a continuous data set so as not to "missing something"; 2nd, since the fact that individual usually takes sometime to have his/her mind changed, and that most people don't spend all day on twitter, thus each individual's activity is rather sparse in time, thus one need to correct data for a reasonably long period of time. 

The Phase1 of this project is devoted to data cleaning and extract basic relevent information from this huge data set.
